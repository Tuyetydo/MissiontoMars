## Overview of Project
Robin wants to polish her web app. She had been admiring images of Mars's hemispheres online and realized that the site is scarping-friendly. She wants to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. 

### Purpose
The purpose is to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hjemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accomodate these images. 

- [x] Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
